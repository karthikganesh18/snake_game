# snake_game
The code employs Python's Turtle graphics for a classic Snake game. Players steer the snake to eat while avoiding collisions with walls and its tail. The game loop manages movement and collisions. The Snake and Food classes control behavior and placement. A Scoreboard class tracks and displays scores.
